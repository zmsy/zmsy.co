## The Frontpage of this Site Needed Graphics

I've just finished _finally_ publishing my blog site, and I needed something to make the frontpage look, well, a little more interesting. Since I focus most of my work on data analysis and visualization, I figured it made sense that the splash page have some sort of data visualization on it.

### Data

Turned to my favorite source for miscellaneous data - baseball statistics. Baseball completely destroys all other sports in both the volume and availability of information available.

* [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com)
